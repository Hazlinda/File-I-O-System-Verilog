# File-I-O-System-Verilog
In order to use the tasks $fdisplay, $fmonitor etc., you must first open a file using the system function $fopen.  $fopen requires a file name and a mode. To open a file for writing, the mode is "w". $fopen returns an integer value – file descriptor – or 0 if the file could not be opened. This may happen if, for example, the disk is full, or there is no privilege to write to the specified file. It is a good idea to check the value returned by $fopen.  The file descriptor is then used as the first argument when calling $fdisplay, $fmonitor etc. The other arguments are exactly the same as for the corresponding tasks ($display, $monitor etc.)  When you have finished writing to the file, you can close the file with the system task $fclose. Files that are not closed with this system task are automatically closed when simulation finishes
